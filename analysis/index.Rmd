Providing background, code and guidance to help R users interested in exploring and visualizing Vegetation Departure (VDEP; see About page for VDEP documentation).  We will be working with data from the Southern High Allegheny Mountains subsection (aka "335Ba"; [Cleland et al., 2007](https://www.fs.usda.gov/research/treesearch/48672){target="blank"}), located in West Virginia:

<br>

```{r locator map, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# load packages

library(sf)
library(terra)
library(tidyverse)
library(tmap)

#  read shape
shp <- st_read("data/sub335Ba.shp", quiet = TRUE) %>% 
  st_transform(crs = 5070) %>%
  st_union() %>%
  st_sf()
# toggle tmap mode to interactive viewing
tmap_mode("view")

# create a quick interactive map
quickmap <- qtm(shp, 
                borders = "darkgreen", 
                fill = NULL, 
                check.and.fix = TRUE, 
                basemaps = 'https://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/World_Topo_Map/MapServer/tile/{z}/{y}/{x}',
                title = 'Southern High Allegheny Mountains Subsection',)

quickmap
```
